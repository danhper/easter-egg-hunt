# Easter egg hunt

This is a simple web application to create an easter egg hunt game.
The application is divided into two parts: the end-user interface and the admin interface. The end-user interface is used to view the easter eggs and submit answers. The admin interface is used to manage the easter eggs, hints, and answers.
This was created for a one-off event and is not particularly designed to be extensible or reusable, so if you want to use it, you will likely have to modify it to fit your needs.

Below is a list of the implemented features.
